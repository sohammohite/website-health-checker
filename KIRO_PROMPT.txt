Prompt used for AWS Kiro AI:

Generate a complete Python script that acts as a simple website uptime and performance monitor. It should be beginner-friendly but production-useful. The script must include the following features:

- Check website uptime (200 OK = UP, anything else = DOWN)
- Measure response time in milliseconds
- Configurable timeout for HTTP requests
- Check multiple URLs from a list
- Console logging (UP/DOWN + response time + timestamp)
- Write logs to a CSV file automatically
- Send alert notifications on email when a website is DOWN
- Use only standard Python libraries + requests
